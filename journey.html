              What have I learned & accomplished so far?
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              I have gained so much knowledge in the last 14 weeks I don't think
              I could write it all down. When I think back about the first week
              and our homework it's a massive difference. I rememebr being in
              the library thinking "wow this is so hard I will never know how
              this works". that was JUST HTML/CSS. Now we are neck deep in the
              back end and working toward front end proficiency. It's like night
              and day and when I am feeling very frustrated It gives me a lot of
              perspective to look back to that first study group.
            </p>
            <p>
              My biggest accomplishment is becoming a better learner. I haven't
              been in school for a long time but I know that this time around I
              am learning so much more. I am more dedicated and diligent about
              this program and it is so rewarding. I have gotten better at
              networking, working as a group and asking questions because of
              this course and I know it is only up from here.
            </p>

              Let's look back at the first week...
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Before the first week of class even started I already wanted to
              quit. I started the prework and I was already lost. I was
              frustrated and confused and had myself convinced I wasn't cut out
              for this. I started from scratch, turned up my concentration and
              pushed thru to the first day.
            </p>
            <p>
              Moving on to the very first week. Cue second full on breakdown.
              Nearly in tears in the library because I felt defeated by basic
              HTML and CSS. I thought - "this is the easiest part of the class
              and I can't even get out of the gate on it!". Once the breakthough
              happened it was like an addiction began. Creating something then
              working every line to make sure it's perfect becomes so rewarding
              that you don't want to stop. (Or you can't stop, depending on the
              project)
