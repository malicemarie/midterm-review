              My goals for the remainder of the course:
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              For the remainder of this course I want to focus on the details
              and honing my skills. I still feel like I have to copy and paste a
              lot and It's partly because I am struggling with my syntax and a
              better understanding of the details will help me a lot. Less copy
              and paste, more coding!
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="tm-content">
            <h2 class="tm-page-title">
              What will I accomplish before the course completes; and after.
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              Before the course completes my main goal is to do a mock
              interview. I am terrified and I am so nervous to participate so
              It's part being prepared and a BIG part getting up the guts. After
              the course is over I want to work really hard to make connections
              and find genuine interest in different companies
            </p>
            <p>
              In order to accomplish these goals I was to become more prepared
              for interviews. Not just by making more connections and deciding
              what direction I want to go but also being technically prepared.
              Putting in extra work to learn data structures, algorithms &
              syntax that is important to know off the top of my head.
            </p>

          <div class="tm-content">
            <h2 class="tm-page-title">
              How is my path evolving?
            </h2>
            <p class="mb-4">
              When I started boot camp my main goal was to go back to school and
              change my career. I had no idea what I was going to be good at,
              what I was going to like and dislike, and how I was going to
              become employable in a new field. As class moves along I have been
              so overwhelmed with information that I am even MORE excited about
              the direction this may go. There are so many branches of tech and
              I can't wait to continue to learn and grow in and outside of class
              so I can find my place.
